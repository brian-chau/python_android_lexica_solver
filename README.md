# Python implementation of a solver for Lexica Android game

Lexica is an open-source Android game available on F-Droid. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/lexica/lexica) on GitHub.

The goal of the game is to find as many words as possible in the grid, where the word can go up, down, left, right, and/or diagonal in the grid.

This source code is borrowed from a Leetcode solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/discuss/1648500/Python-backtrack-solution), where I added the code to look in the diagonal directions as well.
